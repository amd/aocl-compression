 * This flag doesn't affect the memory usage requirements of the decoder (at

 * a little but only at the lowest preset levels (0-3).

* This flag only affects the checks of the compressed data itself; the CRC32

*
* Don't use this flag unless you know what you are doing. Possible reasons
* to use this flag:
*
*   - Trying to recover data from a corrupt .xz file.
*
*   - Speeding up decompression, which matters mostly with SHA-256
*     or with files that have compressed extremely well. It's recommended

*     verified externally in some other way.

* This flag enables decoding of concatenated files with file formats that

* supported by liblzma, only the .xz and .lz formats allow concatenated
* files. Concatenated files are not allowed with the legacy .lzma format.
*
* This flag also affects the usage of the `action' argument for lzma_code().
* When LZMA_CONCATENATED is used, lzma_code() won't return LZMA_STREAM_END
* unless LZMA_FINISH is used as `action'. Thus, the application has to set
* LZMA_FINISH in the same way as it does when encoding.
*
* If LZMA_CONCATENATED is not used, the decoders still accept LZMA_FINISH
* as `action' for lzma_code(), but the usage of LZMA_FINISH isn't required.

/**
* This flag makes the threaded decoder report errors (like LZMA_DATA_ERROR)
* as soon as they are detected. This saves time when the application has no
* interest in a partially decompressed truncated or corrupt file. Note that
* due to timing randomness, if the same truncated or corrupt input is
* decompressed multiple times with this flag, a different amount of output
* may be produced by different runs, and even the error code might vary.
*
* When using LZMA_FAIL_FAST, it is recommended to use LZMA_FINISH to tell
* the decoder when no more input will be coming because it can help fast
* detection and reporting of truncated files. Note that in this situation
* truncated files might be diagnosed with LZMA_DATA_ERROR instead of
* LZMA_OK or LZMA_BUF_ERROR!
*
* Without this flag the threaded decoder will provide as much output as
* possible at first and then report the pending error. This default behavior
* matches the single-threaded decoder and provides repeatable behavior
* with truncated or corrupt input. There are a few special cases where the
* behavior can still differ like memory allocation failures (LZMA_MEM_ERROR).
*
* Single-threaded decoders currently ignore this flag.
*
* Support for this flag was added in liblzma 5.3.3alpha. Note that in older
* versions this flag isn't supported (LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR) even by functions
* that ignore this flag in newer liblzma versions.
