 * \param       allocator   lzma_allocator for custom allocator functions.
 *                          Set to NULL to use malloc() and free().

 * \param       out         Beginning of the output buffer

 *                          *out_pos is updated only if encoding succeeds.
 * \param       out_size    Size of the out buffer; the first byte into
 *                          which no data is written to is out[out_size].
