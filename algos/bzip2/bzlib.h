 * @brief bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.
 *  Compression is considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, 
 *  and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

* 
* | Parameters | Direction   | Description |
* |:-----------|:-----------:|:------------|
* | \b strm             | in,out   | Holds all data pertaining to the compression activity. It should be allocated and initialised prior to the call.  |
* | \b blockSize100k    | in       | Specifies the block size to be used for compression. It should be a value between 1 and 9 inclusive, and the actual block size used is 100000 x this figure. |
* | \b verbosity        | in       | A number between 0 and 4 inclusive. 0 is silent, and greater numbers give increasingly verbose monitoring/debugging output. |
* | \b workFactor       | in       | Controls how the compression phase behaves when presented with worst case, highly repetitive, input data. |
*
* @return
* | Result     | Description |
* |:-----------|:------------|
* | Success    | `BZ_OK`       |
* | Fail       | `BZ_CONFIG_ERROR` - If the library has been mis-compiled |
* | ^          | `BZ_PARAM_ERROR` \n If strm is NULL \n or blockSize < 1 or blockSize > 9 \n or verbosity < 0 or verbosity > 4 \n or workFactor < 0 or workFactor > 250 |
* | ^          | `BZ_MEM_ERROR` - If available memory is insufficient. |
*
* @note 
* -# `blockSize100k` = 9 gives the best compression but takes most memory. 
* -# If the library has been compiled with  `-DBZ_NO_STDIO`, no monitoring/debugging output will appear for any verbosity setting.
* -# If compression runs into difficulties caused by repetitive data, the library switches from the <b> standard sorting algorithm </b> to a <b> fallback algorithm </b>.
* The fallback is slower than the standard algorithm by perhaps a factor of three, but always behaves reasonably, no matter how bad the input.
* 
* -# Lower values of `workFactor` reduce the amount of effort the standard algorithm will expend before resorting to the fallback. Set this parameter carefully; 
*  - too low, and many inputs will be handled by the fallback algorithm and so compress rather slowly, 
*  - too high, and your average-to-worst case compression times can become very large. 
*  - The default value of \b 30 gives reasonable behaviour over a wide range of circumstances. \n
* Allowable values range from \b 0 to \b 250 inclusive. 0 is a special case, equivalent to using the default value of 30.
* 
* -# Upon return, the internal state will have been allocated and initialised, and `total_in_lo32`, `total_in_hi32`, `total_out_lo32` and `total_out_hi32` will have been set to zero. 
* These four fields are used by the library to inform the caller of the total amount of data passed into and out of the library, respectively. You should not try to change them. \n 
* As of version 1.0, 64-bit counts are maintained, even on 32-bit platforms, using the `_hi32` fields to store the upper 32 bits of the count. So, for example, the total amount of data in is (total_in_hi32 << 32) + total_in_lo32.

/**
 * @name High(er) level library functions
 * @brief This interface provides functions for reading and writing bzip2 format files. First, some general points.
 *
 * -# All of the functions take an `int*` first argument, `bzerror`. After each call, `bzerror` should be consulted first 
 * to determine the outcome of the call. If `bzerror` is `BZ_OK`, the call completed successfully, and only then should the 
 * return value of the function (if any) be consulted. If `bzerror` is `BZ_IO_ERROR`, there was an error reading/writing the 
 * underlying compressed file, and you should then consult `errno` / `perror` to determine the cause of the difficulty. 
 * `bzerror` may also be set to various other values; precise details are given on a per-function basis below.
 *
 * -# If `bzerror` indicates an error (ie, anything except `BZ_OK` and `BZ_STREAM_END`), you should immediately 
 * call `BZ2_bzReadClose` (or `BZ2_bzWriteClose`, depending on whether you are attempting to read or to write) to 
 * free up all resources associated with the stream. Once an error has been indicated, behaviour of all calls except 
 * `BZ2_bzReadClose` / `BZ2_bzWriteClose` is undefined. The implication is that 
 *  - `bzerror` should be checked after each call, and 
 *  - if bzerror indicates an error, `BZ2_bzReadClose` / `BZ2_bzWriteClose` should then be called to clean up.
 * 
 * -# The `FILE*` arguments passed to `BZ2_bzReadOpen` / `BZ2_bzWriteOpen` should be set to binary mode. 
 * Most Unix systems will do this by default, but other platforms, including Windows and Mac, will not. 
 * If you omit this, you may encounter problems when moving code to new platforms.
 *
 * -# Memory allocation requests are handled by `malloc` / `free`. At present there is no facility for 
 * user-defined memory allocators in the file I/O functions (could easily be added, though).

*  - `BZ_IO_ERROR` - If there is an error reading from the compressed file
*  - `BZ_UNEXPECTED_EOF` - If the compressed file ended before the logical end-of-stream was detected
*  - `BZ_DATA_ERROR` - If a data integrity error was detected in the compressed stream
*  - `BZ_DATA_ERROR_MAGIC` - If the stream does not begin with the requisite header bytes 
*                            (ie, is not a bzip2 data file).  This is really a special case of BZ_DATA_ERROR.
*  - `BZ_MEM_ERROR` - If available memory is insufficient.
*  - `BZ_STREAM_END` - If the logical end of stream was detected.
*  - `BZ_OK` - otherwise.
* 
* -# If the read was successful, bzerror is set to `BZ_OK` and the number of bytes read is returned. If the logical

*
* -# Internally, BZ2_bzRead copies data from the compressed file in chunks of size `BZ_MAX_UNUSED` bytes before decompressing it. 
*    If the file contains more bytes than strictly needed to reach the logical end-of-stream, BZ2_bzRead will almost certainly 
*    read some of the trailing data before signalling `BZ_SEQUENCE_END`. To collect the read but unused data once`BZ_SEQUENCE_END`
