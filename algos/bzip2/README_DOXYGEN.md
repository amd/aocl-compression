BZIP2 - Introduction
====================
Bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

This file is part of bzip2/libbzip2, a program and library for
lossless, block-sorting data compression.
