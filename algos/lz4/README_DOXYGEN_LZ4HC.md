LZ4HC - Introduction
====================
LZ4HC is the High Compression variant of LZ4.
It offers more compression ratio at the cost of compression speed.
The files lz4hc.c and lz4hc.h add the support for LZ4HC.

This variant also compresses data using the LZ4 block format, 
and depends on regular lib/lz4.* source files.

It is covered by the same LICENSE as that of LZ4.
