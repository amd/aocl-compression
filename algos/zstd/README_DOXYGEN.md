ZSTD - Introduction
===================
__Zstandard__, or `zstd` as short version, is a fast lossless compression algorithm,
targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios.
It's backed by a very fast entropy stage, provided by [Huff0 and FSE library](https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy).

The project is provided as an open-source dual [BSD](LICENSE) and [GPLv2](COPYING) licensed **C** library,
and a command line utility producing and decoding `.zst`, `.gz`, `.xz` and `.lz4` files.
Should your project require another programming language,
a list of known ports and bindings is provided on [Zstandard homepage](http://www.zstd.net/#other-languages).

The negative compression levels, specified with `--fast=#`,
offer faster compression and decompression speed in exchange for some loss in
compression ratio compared to level 1, as seen in the table above.

Zstd can also offer stronger compression ratios at the cost of compression speed.
Speed vs Compression trade-off is configurable by small increments.
Decompression speed is preserved and remains roughly the same at all settings,
a property shared by most LZ compression algorithms, such as [zlib] or lzma.


## The case for Small Data compression

Previous charts provide results applicable to typical file and stream scenarios (several MB). Small data comes with different perspectives.

The smaller the amount of data to compress, the more difficult it is to compress. This problem is common to all compression algorithms, and reason is, compression algorithms learn from past data how to compress future data. But at the beginning of a new data set, there is no "past" to build upon.

To solve this situation, Zstd offers a __training mode__, which can be used to tune the algorithm for a selected type of data.
Training Zstandard is achieved by providing it with a few samples (one file per sample). The result of this training is stored in a file called "dictionary", which must be loaded before compression and decompression.
Using this dictionary, the compression ratio achievable on small data improves dramatically.

Training works if there is some correlation in a family of small data samples. The more data-specific a dictionary is, the more efficient it is (there is no _universal dictionary_).
Hence, deploying one dictionary per type of data will provide the greatest benefits.
Dictionary gains are mostly effective in the first few KB. Then, the compression algorithm will gradually use previously decoded content to better compress the rest of the file.

### Dictionary compression How To:

1. Create the dictionary

   `zstd --train FullPathToTrainingSet/* -o dictionaryName`

2. Compress with dictionary

   `zstd -D dictionaryName FILE`

3. Decompress with dictionary

   `zstd -D dictionaryName --decompress FILE.zst`
