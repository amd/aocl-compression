* Cache efficient hash chains (cehc):
* Hash chains are used for collision resolution when a hashing 
* function generates same hashing index (hashIdx) for different inputs.
* Hash chains that are typically implemented using
* linked-lists have poor cache locality.
* 
* Here we implement hash chains with continuously positioned nodes.
* A hash table (hashTable) is used to store the mapping of hashIdx
* to root nodes of hash chains (chainIdx). 
* The hash chains in turn are stored in an array (chainTable).
* The chainIdx points to the hash chain (hashChain) within the chainTable.
* 
* Typical data access pattern would be as follows:
*                                               [hashTable]    
*                                             hashIdx chainIdx
*                                           |        |        |
* input -> [hashing function] -> hashIdx -> |        |        | -> chainIdx
*                                           |        |        |
*
*                                [chainTable]
* chainIdx -> [hashChain_0][hashChain_1]...[hashChain_N] -> hashChain
*
* Begin of common macros for cache efficient hash chains
* Note: Macros do not handle invalid inputs. Calling functions must ensure
*       tables are allocated properly and valid inputs are passed

/******************************************************************************
* Begin of AOCL_COMMON_CEHCFIX:
* cache efficient hash chains with fixed block mapping (CEHCFIX)
* In this implementation of cehc, each hashIdx is mapped to a fixed size
* array in the chainTable that holds its associated hashChain. No separate
* hashTable is needed due to this fixed mapping.
* hashIdx h0 maps to hashChain0, h1 to hashChain1 and so on.
* 
* Params:
* chainTable           : Array of hash chain objects.
*                        Each hash chain object contains a hashChain and 
*                        a head position indicator field (hcHeadPos).
*                        hashChain: hash chain implemented using a circular buffer.
*                        hcHeadPos: position of head of hash chain within the circular buffer.
*                        Format: [hcHeadPos_0|hashChain_0] [hcHeadPos_1|hashChain_1] ... [hcHeadPos_N|hashChain_N]
* hcBase               : Pointer to a hash chain object within chainTable.
* hcCur                : Pointer to nodes within a hash chain object.
* val                  : Value of a node stored within a hash chain.
* hashIdx              : Hash index.
* HASH_CHAIN_MAX       : Max size of hashChain that can be stored within each hash chain object.
* HASH_CHAIN_OBJECT_SZ : Size of each hash chain object. Must be [1 + HASH_CHAIN_MAX].
* kEmptyHeadValue      : Value of empty hcHeadPos.
* kEmptyNodeValue      : Value of empty node in hashChain.
* 
* Typical usage sequence:
* To do an Insert operation, APIs must be called in the following order:
* 1. Call AOCL_COMMON_CEHCFIX_GET_HEAD() to get hcHeadPos.
* 2. Add new node in hashChain at the position next to hcHeadPos 
*    using AOCL_COMMON_CEHCFIX_INSERT(). Also updates hcHeadPos.
* 
* To do a Search operation, APIs must be called in the following order:
* 1. Call AOCL_COMMON_CEHCFIX_GET_HEAD() to get hcHeadPos.
* 2. Call AOCL_COMMON_CEHCFIX_GET() to read value at this position
*    in the hash chain.
* 3. Subsequently, keep calling AOCL_COMMON_CEHCFIX_MOVE_TO_NEXT() 
*    to move to next nodes in the chain and read values there.
