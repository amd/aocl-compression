/*
   Decode literal, length, and distance codes and write out the resulting
   literal and match bytes until either not enough input or output is
   available, an end-of-block is encountered, or a data error is encountered.
   When large enough input and output buffers are supplied to inflate(), for
   example, a 16K input buffer and a 64K output buffer, more than 95% of the
   inflate execution time is spent in this routine.

   Entry assumptions:

        state->mode == LEN
        strm->avail_in >= INFLATE_FAST_MIN_HAVE
        strm->avail_out >= INFLATE_FAST_MIN_LEFT
        start >= strm->avail_out
        state->bits < 8

   On return, state->mode is one of:

        LEN -- ran out of enough output space or enough available input
        TYPE -- reached end of block code, inflate() to interpret next block
        BAD -- error in block data

   Notes:

    - The maximum input bits used by a length/distance pair is 15 bits for the
      length code, 5 bits for the length extra, 15 bits for the distance code,
      and 13 bits for the distance extra.  This totals 48 bits, or six bytes.
      Therefore if strm->avail_in >= 6, then there is enough input to avoid
      checking for available input while decoding.

    - On some architectures, it can be significantly faster (e.g. up to 1.2x
      faster on x86_64) to load from strm->next_in 64 bits, or 8 bytes, at a
      time, so INFLATE_FAST_MIN_HAVE == 8.

    - The maximum bytes that a single length/distance pair can output is 258
      bytes, which is the maximum length that can be coded.  inflate_fast()
      requires strm->avail_out >= 258 for each loop to avoid checking for
      output space.

    /* hold is a local copy of strm->hold. By default, hold satisfies the same
       invariants that strm->hold does, namely that (hold >> bits) == 0. This
       invariant is kept by loading bits into hold one byte at a time, like:

       hold |= next_byte_of_input << bits; in++; bits += 8;

       If we need to ensure that bits >= 15 then this code snippet is simply
       repeated. Over one iteration of the outermost do/while loop, this
       happens up to six times (48 bits of input), as described in the NOTES
       above.

       However, on some little endian architectures, it can be significantly
       faster to load 64 bits once instead of 8 bits six times:

       if (bits <= 16) {
         hold |= next_8_bytes_of_input << bits; in += 6; bits += 48;
       }

       Unlike the simpler one byte load, shifting the next_8_bytes_of_input
       by bits will overflow and lose those high bits, up to 2 bytes' worth.
       The conservative estimate is therefore that we have read only 6 bytes
       (48 bits). Again, as per the NOTES above, 48 bits is sufficient for the
       rest of the iteration, and we will not need to load another 8 bytes.

       Inside this function, we no longer satisfy (hold >> bits) == 0, but
       this is not problematic, even if that overflow does not land on an 8 bit
       byte boundary. Those excess bits will eventually shift down lower as the
       Huffman decoder consumes input, and when new input bits need to be loaded
       into the bits variable, the same input bits will be or'ed over those
       existing bits. A bitwise or is idempotent: (a | b | b) equals (a | b).
       Note that we therefore write that load operation as "hold |= etc" and not
       "hold += etc".

       Outside that loop, at the end of the function, hold is bitwise and'ed
       with (1<<bits)-1 to drop those excess bits so that, on function exit, we
       keep the invariant that (state->hold >> state->bits) == 0.

   inflate_fast() speedups that turned out slower (on a PowerPC G3 750CXe):
   - Using bit fields for code structure
   - Different op definition to avoid & for extra bits (do & for table bits)
   - Three separate decoding do-loops for direct, window, and wnext == 0
   - Special case for distance > 1 copies to do overlapped load and store copy
   - Explicit branch predictions (based on measured branch probabilities)
   - Deferring match copy and interspersed it with decoding subsequent codes
   - Swapping literal/length else
   - Swapping window/direct else
   - Larger unrolled copy loops (three is about right)
   - Moving len -= 3 statement into middle of loop
